## Exercises

1. The data in `songs` contain the length in minutes of the 3,000 songs I have
on my phone (the entire population). What is the population mean and 
standard deviation of song length?

2. What is the probability that a randomly selected song is longer than 5
minutes long?

3. Set seed `12345` and take a random sample of 100 songs. Construct a 95% 
confidence interval for the mean song length using your random sample. Did your
interval contain the true population value?

4. Iâ€™m about to take a trip to visit friends and the drive is 6 hours, and
suppose I make a random playlist of 100 songs. What is the probability that my 
playlist lasts the entire drive?
